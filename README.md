# Command Doom Launcher
### A launcher for Doom for the command line. Written in straight up C (which makes this my first C program ever!)

## Configuration
On Windows, the default IWAD path is `C:\Users\<username>\Documents`, and on other OSes, it's `/usr/share/games/doom`.

You can change this by editing `config.h` (`config.win.h` on Windows).

## Compiling

You just need to run `build.sh`. (batch file will be added for Windows)
It'll automatically compile and run.
