# Command Doom Launcher
### A launcher for Doom for the command line. Written in straight up C (which makes this my first C program ever!)

## Configuration
On Windows, the default IWAD path is `C:\Users\<username>\Documents`, and on other OSes, it's `/usr/share/games/doom`.

You can change this by editing `config.h` (`config.win.h` on Windows).

## Downloading and compiling
```
git clone https://github.com/That1M8Head/CmdDoomLauncher
cd CmdDoomLauncher
./build.sh
```

### On Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/That1M8Head/CmdDoomLauncher
cd CmdDoomLauncher
build
```
